# rust02_workspace_and_testing
Learning Rust: how to use workspace, binary, library and testing.
## Workspace
For Rust Workspace is a group of projects developed together.
It is easy to make a binary (main.rs, executable) project. But it is not good for testing.
It is easy to make a library (lib.rs) but you can not run it.
With a workplace I can split my application into one binary sourcecode and one library sourcecode. So I have the best of both worlds.  
The result is still just one executble file. I don't loose this. That is great with Rust.  
## date_diff
I want to make a simple CLI (console line interface) application that calculates date difference. I need it to know how many days I am on vacation.  
I try to use all smallcaps and underscores for all the file/folder names because of the case sensitivity of Linux file system.  
## Github and Git
I pushed my code to github using Git. I suppose you have git already if you learned from my project Rust01_the_beginning.
Cloning a Github repository to a local folder is super simple.
